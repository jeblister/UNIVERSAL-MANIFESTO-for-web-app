# UNIVERSAL-MANIFESTO-for-web-app
As part of change in the JavaScript world. I write this manifesto to share with the community the rules of Universal (Isomorphic) application.


It provides a set of rules that all JS communities and groups, no matter what stacks they shoose, should abide by, uniting JS Universal application as a movement. They are:

1. Our law
> ..

2. Our conviction
> ...

3. Our aim
>  ...

4. Our method
> ..

5. Our primary means
> ...

6. Any other means
> ..

7. Our freedom
> ...
